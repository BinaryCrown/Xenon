# Xenon
A nonsense-looking but sense-making esolang. To run, use <code>interpreter.py</code> and pass the path to the file to run as a command-line argument. Alternatively, if you're on Linux, use <code>runner.sh</code>. This script also can run <code>padder.py</code>, which converts XOB files into XEN files (and running it twice allows you to execute the then-generated XEN file).
